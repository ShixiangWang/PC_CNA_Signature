	abstract = {Background: To identify clinically relevant genomic rearrangement signatures in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), we conducted a retrospective analysis of sequenced HGSOC whole-tumor genomes.
Methods: Clinical data and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads were obtained for primary HGSOC tumors sequenced by the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS; n ¼ 80). Genomic rearrangements were identiﬁed, and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to extract rearrangement signatures. The cohort was then dichotomized around the median signature contribution, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. An independent cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer study (n ¼ 490) was also examined. The TCGA cohort was dichotomized around the median similarity between tumor copy number proﬁle and a prognostic rearrangement signature, and OS was analyzed. Outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression methods. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: We identiﬁed ﬁve genomic rearrangement signatures (Ov.RS1-5) in HGSOC. Ov.RS3 exhibited 10 kilobase to 10 megabase deletions and tandem duplications, and patients whose tumors exhibited a high contribution from Ov.RS3 had poor OS. The median OS was 22.7 months (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] ¼ 20.2 to 39.0 months) in the Ov.RS3-high group vs 38.2 months (95\% CI ¼ 22.7 to 69.1 months) in the Ov.RS3-low group (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 1.86, 95\% CI ¼ 1.12 to 3.09, P ¼ .02). For the independent TCGA cohort, median OS rates were 38.0 months (95\% CI ¼ 35.3 to 41.4 months) in the Ov.RS3 highsimilarity group vs 48.9 months (95\% CI ¼ 44.1 to 57.1 months) in the Ov.RS3 low-similarity group (HR ¼ 1.54, 95\% CI ¼ 1.21 to 1.97, P {\textless} .001).
Conclusion: A novel genomic rearrangement signature is associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a lethal malignancy that is diagnosed in approximately 22 000 women per year in the United States (1). Initial treatment of advanced HGSOC involves a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Molecularly targeted therapies such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are now being used in the treatment of recurrent disease (2). Of these targeted therapies, PARP inhibitors act in synergy with homologous recombination repair pathway deficiency (HRD), a genomic instability phenotype exhibited by a subset of HGSOC (3).},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature. Using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole cancer genome and 19,184 exome sequences encompassing most cancer types we characterised 49 single base substitution, 11 doublet base substitution, four clustered base substitution, and 17 small insertion and deletion mutational signatures. The substantial dataset size compared to previous analyses enabled discovery of new signatures, separation of overlapping signatures and decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated, but distinct, DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. Estimation of the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes revealed associations with exogenous and endogenous exposures and defective DNA maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a comprehensive perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes contributing to the development of human cancer.},

	abstract = {Allele-speciﬁc copy number analysis (ASCN) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data can greatly extend the utility of NGS beyond the identiﬁcation of mutations to precisely annotate the genome for the detection of homozygous/heterozygous deletions, copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), allelespeciﬁc gains/ampliﬁcations. In addition, as targeted gene panels are increasingly used in clinical sequencing studies for the detection of ‘actionable’ mutations and copy number alterations to guide treatment decisions, accurate, tumor purity-, ploidyand clonal heterogeneity-adjusted integer copy number calls are greatly needed to more reliably interpret NGS-based cancer gene copy number data in the context of clinical sequencing. We developed FACETS, an ASCN tool and open-source software with a broad application to whole genome, wholeexome, as well as targeted panel sequencing platforms. It is a fully integrated stand-alone pipeline that includes sequencing BAM ﬁle post-processing, joint segmentation of total- and allele-speciﬁc read counts, and integer copy number calls corrected for tumor purity, ploidy and clonal heterogeneity, with comprehensive output and integrated visualization. We demonstrate the application of FACETS using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-exome sequencing of lung adenocarcinoma samples. We also demonstrate its application to a clinical sequencing platform based on a targeted gene panel.},
